# Welcome

- projects (let's build awesome wysiwyg, cms, user management, content management, crowd-sourced communities!)
- broaden our skillsets (we don't need to know everything about everything.  but we should know the most important things about a lot of things)




I want to create a web development firm.  I think of it more as a digital agency.  I want to document everything I (or anyone) might need to know in order to do that.

## Learn
- beginner or pro
- distilled knowledge
- organized by level, importance, etc
- every folder should have an overview.md file
- every folder's readme.md should have newbie links
- every topic doesn't need to rewrite the super-basic "where am I?" guide - a basic understanding of concepts (regardless of actual implementation details) can be extracted from the actual implementation pages...

## Topics
- design, UI/UX, etc
- development, programming, coding, etc
- deployment, devOps, hosting, server admin, security, etc
